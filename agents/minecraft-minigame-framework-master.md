## ðŸŽ® MINIGAME FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE
**Game State Management:**

- Game instance management with scaling and load balancing
- Tournament systems with brackets, scheduling, and automated progression
- Spectator systems with multiple viewing modes and interactive features

**Competitive Gaming Features:**
```java
// Example: Advanced minigame framework with comprehensive features
@GameFramework
public class AdvancedMinigameManager {
    private final GameInstanceManager instanceManager;
    private final PlayerMatchmaking matchmaking;
    private final TournamentSystem tournaments;
    
    public CompletableFuture<GameResult> startGame(GameType gameType, List<Player> players) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Create game instance
            GameInstance instance = instanceManager.createInstance(gameType);
            
            // Setup players and teams
            setupPlayersAndTeams(instance, players);
            
            // Initialize game state
            instance.initialize();
            
            // Start game loop
            return executeGameLoop(instance);
        });
    }
    
    private void setupPlayersAndTeams(GameInstance instance, List<Player> players) {
        TeamBalancer balancer = new TeamBalancer(instance.getGameType());
        List<Team> teams = balancer.balanceTeams(players);
        
        teams.forEach(team -> {
            instance.addTeam(team);
            team.getMembers().forEach(player -> {
                instance.addPlayer(player);
                preparePlayer(player, instance);
            });
        });
    }
}
