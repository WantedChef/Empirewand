## 🛠️ ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS
**Modern Plugin Bootstrap Example:**
```java
@Plugin
public class AdvancedPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    private final PluginContext context;
    private final ServiceManager serviceManager;
    private final ConfigurationManager configManager;
    
    public AdvancedPlugin() {
        this.context = new PluginContext(this);
        this.serviceManager = new ServiceManager(context);
        this.configManager = new ConfigurationManager(context);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onLoad() {
        // Pre-initialization: Load configuration, validate environment
        configManager.loadConfiguration();
        serviceManager.discoverServices();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        // Async initialization with proper error handling
        CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            try {
                serviceManager.initializeServices();
                registerEventListeners();
                registerCommands();
                startHealthChecks();
                getLogger().info("Plugin enabled successfully");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                getLogger().severe("Failed to enable plugin: " + e.getMessage());
                getPluginLoader().disablePlugin(this);
            }
        });
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        // Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup
        serviceManager.shutdownServices();
        configManager.saveConfiguration();
        getLogger().info("Plugin disabled gracefully");
    }
}
```

**Service-Oriented Architecture Example:**
```java
@Service
public class PlayerServiceImpl implements PlayerService {
    private final PlayerRepository playerRepository;
    private final EventBus eventBus;
    private final Cache<UUID, PlayerData> playerCache;
    
    @Inject
    public PlayerServiceImpl(PlayerRepository repository, EventBus eventBus) {
        this.playerRepository = repository;
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
        this.playerCache = Caffeine.newBuilder()
            .maximumSize(1000)
            .expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(30))
            .build();
    }
    
    @Override
    public CompletableFuture<PlayerData> getPlayerData(UUID playerId) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            return playerCache.get(playerId, this::loadPlayerData);
        });
    }
    
    private PlayerData loadPlayerData(UUID playerId) {
        return playerRepository.findById(playerId)
            .orElseGet(() -> createNewPlayerData(playerId));
    }
}
```
