    private final GuildService guildService;
    private final ChatChannelManager channelManager;
    
    public void sendPrivateMessage(Player sender, Player recipient, Component message) {
        // Check friendship status and permissions
        if (!canSendMessage(sender, recipient)) {
            notifyCannotMessage(sender, recipient);
            return;
        }
        
        // Apply formatting and filters
        Component formattedMessage = formatPrivateMessage(sender, message);
        Component filteredMessage = applyContentFilter(formattedMessage);
        
        // Send message
        recipient.sendMessage(filteredMessage);
        sender.sendMessage(createSentConfirmation(recipient, filteredMessage));
