    private static final HandlerList HANDLERS = new HandlerList();
    private boolean cancelled = false;
    private final Player trader;
    private final Player counterpart;
    private final TradeOffer offer;
    private final TradeContext context;
    private final long timestamp;
    
    public AdvancedTradeEvent(@NotNull Player trader, @NotNull Player counterpart,
                             @NotNull TradeOffer offer, @NotNull TradeContext context) {
        super(trader);
        this.trader = trader;
        this.counterpart = counterpart;
        this.offer = offer;
        this.context = context;
        this.timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();
    }
    
    // Comprehensive event data with validation and performance considerations
    public boolean isValid() {
        return trader.isOnline() && counterpart.isOnline() && 
               offer.isValid() && context.isActive();
    }
    
    public CompletableFuture<TradeResult> executeAsync() {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Async trade execution with proper error handling
            return context.executeTrade(offer);
        });
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean isCancelled() { return cancelled; }
    
    @Override
    public void setCancelled(boolean cancel) { this.cancelled = cancel; }
    
    @Override
    public @NotNull HandlerList getHandlers() { return HANDLERS; }

// Example: Multi-stage event processing pipeline
@Component
public class EventProcessingPipeline {
    private final List<EventProcessor> processors;
    private final EventMetrics metrics;
    
    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        EventContext context = new EventContext(event);
        
        processors.stream()
            .filter(processor -> processor.canProcess(event))
            .forEach(processor -> {
                try {
                    long startTime = System.nanoTime();
                    processor.process(context);
                    metrics.recordProcessingTime(processor.getClass(), 
                        System.nanoTime() - startTime);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    handleProcessingError(processor, event, e);
                }
            });
    }
    
    private void handleProcessingError(EventProcessor processor, Event event, Exception e) {
        getLogger().error("Event processing failed", Map.of(
            "processor", processor.getClass().getSimpleName(),
            "event", event.getClass().getSimpleName(),
            "error", e.getMessage()
        ));
