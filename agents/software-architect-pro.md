## 🛠️ ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS
**Modern Application Bootstrap Example (Spring Boot):**
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAsync
@EnableScheduling
public class ModernApplication {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(ModernApplication.class);
        app.setDefaultProperties(getDefaultProperties());
        app.run(args);
    }
    
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "app.async.enabled", havingValue = "true")
    public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(4);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(8);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(500);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("async-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
    
    @EventListener
    public void handleApplicationReady(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {
        log.info("Application started successfully");
        // Initialize health checks, metrics, etc.
    }
    
    @PreDestroy
    public void onShutdown() {
        log.info("Application shutting down gracefully");
        // Cleanup resources, close connections, etc.
    }
}
```

**Service-Oriented Architecture Example (TypeScript/Node.js):**
```typescript
// Modern dependency injection with decorators
@injectable()
export class UserService {
    constructor(
        @inject('UserRepository') private userRepository: UserRepository,
        @inject('EventBus') private eventBus: EventBus,
        @inject('Cache') private cache: Cache<string, User>
    ) {}
    
    async getUserById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
        // Multi-tier caching strategy
        const cached = await this.cache.get(id);
        if (cached) return cached;
        
        const user = await this.userRepository.findById(id);
        if (user) {
            await this.cache.set(id, user, { ttl: 300 });
            await this.eventBus.publish('user.accessed', { userId: id });
        }
        
        return user;
    }
    
    async createUser(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User> {
        const user = await this.userRepository.create(userData);
        await this.eventBus.publish('user.created', { user });
        return user;
    }
}
```

**Cloud-Native Configuration Example (Python/FastAPI):**
```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str = "Modern API"
    debug: bool = False
    database_url: str
    redis_url: str
    secret_key: str
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        case_sensitive = False

@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

# FastAPI app with modern patterns
app = FastAPI(
    title=get_settings().app_name,
    debug=get_settings().debug,
    docs_url="/api/docs",
    redoc_url="/api/redoc"
)

@app.middleware("http")
async def add_process_time_header(request: Request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    response.headers["X-Process-Time"] = str(process_time)
    return response
```

Always think enterprise-scale, performance-first, maintainability-focused, and cloud-native while leveraging the latest development capabilities and modern software engineering practices across all technology stacks.
