- Proximity-based effect application
- Persistent aura restoration

**Covered Spells**: aura, empire-aura, divine-aura, evil-goons-aura

## Performance Monitoring System

### PerformanceMonitoringListener
**Purpose**: Monitors spell system performance and tracks metrics for optimization

**Key Features**:
- Real-time spell performance tracking
- Player performance metrics
- System-wide performance analysis
- Slow spell detection and logging
- Performance reporting and recommendations
- Memory-efficient tracking with cleanup

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Spell execution times
- Success/failure rates
- Player spell usage patterns
- System-wide performance data

## Coverage Analysis System

### ListenerCoverageAnalyzer
**Purpose**: Analyzes listener coverage for spells and provides development insights

**Key Features**:
- Spell type to listener requirement mapping
- Coverage percentage calculation
- Missing listener identification
- Development recommendations
- Automated coverage reporting

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Spell Registry Integration
- All listeners integrate with the existing SpellRegistry
- Use existing spell configuration system
- Maintain compatibility with current spell implementations

### Service Integration
- Use existing FxService for particle and sound effects
- Integrate with CooldownService for timing effects
- Use ConfigService for spell parameters
- Leverage TaskManager for scheduling

### PDC (PersistentDataContainer) Usage
- Consistent use of Keys class for data storage
- Efficient spell effect tracking
- Player state persistence
- Cross-listener data sharing

## Performance Optimizations

### Event Priority Management
- Strategic use of EventPriority for optimal event handling
- HIGH priority for critical spell effects
- MONITOR priority for tracking and metrics

### Memory Efficiency
- ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe collections
- Automatic cleanup of expired effects
- Efficient proximity checking algorithms
- Lazy initialization of data structures

### Async Processing
- Background cleanup tasks
- Async performance monitoring
- Non-blocking effect processing where possible

## Error Handling and Safety

### Robust Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Detailed error logging
- Event cancellation safety

### Safety Checks
